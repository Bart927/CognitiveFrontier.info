# 🧠 CognitiveFrontier Agent — README

This directory contains documentation and tasks for the agent system responsible for implementing and developing the [CognitiveFrontier.info](https://cognitivefrontier.info) project — a science communication platform for comparative analysis of the human brain and AI.

## 📁 Structure

| File / Folder | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `goal.md`     | Main agent goal — why it exists, what functions it has       |
| `todo.md`     | List of specific tasks in checklist format                   |
| `progress.md` | Progress tracking of stages and development status           |
| `notes.md`    | Free-form notes, technical ideas, reflections                |
| `stages/`     | Detailed description of development stages in separate files |

## 🧠 Agent Purpose

The agent manages the following aspects:

- designing the CognitiveFrontier site structure;
- visualization and expansion of the "Brain vs AI" comparison table;
- publishing and formatting articles, tests, and visual blocks;
- integrating Telegram, Twitter, and other media channels;
- supporting open source project architecture;
- analytics, traffic growth, SEO, OG generation, etc.

## 📌 Usage Recommendations

- Before starting a new work stage — read `goal.md` and current `todo.md`
- Record completed steps in `progress.md`
- Document any key ideas in `notes.md`
- When necessary — create new files in `stages/` with specific task descriptions
